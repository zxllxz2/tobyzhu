title:  VandyHacks 2021!
---

Participated in the VandyHacksVIII for a whole weekend. Slept at the Sarratt Student Center for two nights, altogether less than 3 hours.

Finished the Voyager Cryptor, a website that can conduct encryption and decryption of user-uploaded images using the Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) encryption.

Check the [project post]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/3_project) or its <a href="https://github.com/AllenJWZhu/VandyHacks2021" target="_blank">github repository</a>.

Thanks Allen Zhu, Yilin Liu, and William Liang for taking this Hackason together!

Fun thing:

Here is the original picture before any manipulation:

And here is the same picture after encryption and decryption, however, with the G channel and B channel reversed mistakenly:

Indeed, IMAO.
