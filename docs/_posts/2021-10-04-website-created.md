Many thanks to Dr. Steve Baskauf. It would be impossible for me to build this website without instructions and help from him and his Github courses. The link to his <a href="https://heardlibrary.github.io/digital-scholarship/manage/control/github/" target="_blank">DISC Github Program website</a> is provided here. The

The Digital Scholarship and Communications(DiSC) program at the Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries is a great program for beginners towards some popular techniques. Check its <a href="https://www.library.vanderbilt.edu/disc/workshops/" target="_blank">workshop website</a> if you feel interested.
