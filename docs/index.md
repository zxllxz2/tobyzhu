I am Xiaoliang Zhu, or Toby Zhu, he/him/his.

I study Math, Econ, and CS in [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). Looks like you are from Vanderbilt as well? Great. If you have never heard of this school, forget about it. It doesn't matter.

I have worked for the College of Art & Science and also College of Engineering as a TA, and I'm currently working under [Dr. Kolouri](https://skolouri.github.io/) in [Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) lab](http://lab.vanderbilt.edu/mint-lab) as a RA, researching about catastrophic forgetting in the area of continual learning.

Hope you are still there. Here are some cool things that you may have an interest in. Maybe have a random check?
