I am Xiaoliang Zhu, or Toby Zhu, he/him/his. This is my current <a href="./resume.pdf" target="_blank">resume</a>. Check it if you have an interest.

I study Mathematics, Computer Science, and Economics in <a href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/" target="_blank">Vanderbilt University</a>. If you have never heard of this school (which can be interesting, but still possible), forget about it. It doesn't matter.

I am working for the College of Art & Science as a TA/grader for the course Mathematical Data Science, and I'm currently working under <a href="https://skolouri.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Kolouri</a> in <a href="http://lab.vanderbilt.edu/mint-lab" target="_blank">Machine Intelligence and Neural Technologies (MINT) lab</a> as an undergraduate RA, researching about catastrophic forgetting in the area of continual learning. <a href="https://zxllxz2.github.io/continual_learning/" target="_blank">This is the website of our project</a>. Take a look if you are interested in continual learning.

Hope you are still here. There are some cool things that you may want to look at. Maybe have a random check?
